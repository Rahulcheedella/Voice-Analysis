# 🎙️ Voice Emotion Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Voice Emotion Analysis Dashboard** is a web-based application that analyzes human emotions from voice recordings and visualizes how emotions change over time.  
The system processes audio input, converts speech into text, evaluates sentiment polarity, maps it to emotions, and displays the results in an interactive dashboard.

This project is developed using **Python 3.13**, **Streamlit**, and **NLP-based sentiment analysis**, making it lightweight, stable, and easy to deploy.
